					<h2 class="underline">Staff Positions - Departments</h2>
					<p><b>In our server you can find the following three Staff Positions - Departments:</b></p>
					<div id="staff-devs">
						<h3>1) Staff Department</abbr></h3>
						<p>Staff Department's or Staff Developer's job is answering tickets and making sure that everyone is following the rules and handle all violation issues. Staff Developers are supposed to be friendly, trustworthy but also hard-working and very active with a goal of making the server a better place for everyone.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="admins">
						<h3>2) Admin Department</h3>
						<p>They are responsible for the channels. They organize the announcements / polls / Question Of The Day and give ideas on what we should add / remove They also  type the patch notes for every update. This allows them to be less active than a Staff Developer. They also have to answer the tickets.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="social">
						<h3>3) Social Department - <i>Coming Soon</i></h3>
						<p>Their job is to get partnerships for our server, grow our social media, check each channel for clips and upload some of them to our Official Social Media Accounts.</p>
