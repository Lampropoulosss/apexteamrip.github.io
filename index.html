						<h2 class="subheader">Our 10 Server Rules</h2>
						<p>We're all here to have a fun time and make friends to play games with, but with that being said <span id="establish">we need to establish a few things</span> before we can get to that point.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>No advertising, unless approved by staff.</li>
							<li><em>Listen to staff!</em> <i>
							Staff are here to make sure the server runs smoothly, and to make sure all members are treated with respect and fairness.</i></li>
							<li>Post content in the correct channels, that's why we made them.</li>
							<li>Sending any harmful material such as viruses, IP grabbers, etc. will have you banned from the server immediately. This ban will not be able to be appealed.</li>
							<li><b>Respect discord <abbr class="underline" title="Terms Of Service">TOS</abbr>. Respect discord Terms of Service.</b></li>
							<li>No racism, homophobia, or NSFW content in this server. Cursing is okay, but use common sense please. No NSFW = Not Safe For Work, i.e. porn, gore, suggestive content, etc.</li>
							<li>Message our support bot to ask questions to staff, report, request partnership.</li>
							<li>Spamming pings / mass mention / pinging staff without reason will get you warned</li>
							<li>Messaging(DM) staff members <ins>without any reason</ins> is not allowed.</li>
							<li class="bold">Have fun! We are all here to play games with friends and have fun, so just avoid creating or participating in drama and we'll have a good time!</li>
